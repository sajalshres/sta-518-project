# Analysis of Airbnb listings

## Introduction

Airbnb is an online marketplace that allows millions of people to rent their homes/apartments on a short-term basis to visitors. It provides a medium that connects over 4 million hosts and tourists. I want to explore how Airbnb empowers residential communities and understand the platform, customers, host behavior, and famous neighborhoods.

I want to develop a web application that provides an interactive dashboard containing visualizations to gain insights about Airbnb using the Airbnb dataset in the USA. I also plan to create an API allowing everyone, including students, analysts, and developers, to quickly fetch the data for their tasks.

## Objectives

- To analyze and compare the neighborhoods with their prices.
- To identify various types of properties available in the city.
- To visualize listing on a map based on attributes like price, reviews, and property types.
- To find the most used words used in top listings and reviews

## About Dataset

[Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com) is a website that provides data regarding listings, calendars, reviews, and neighborhood details of various regions throughout the world. I want to limit the data to the United States and focus my examples on Chicago, Illinois, as it is very close to Grand Rapids, and I would love to visit it someday.

Sample dataset for Chicago, Illinois:

- Listing Data: [listings.csv.gz](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/il/chicago/2022-03-17/data/listings.csv.gz)
