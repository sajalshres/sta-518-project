# Analysis of Airbnb listings

## Introduction

Airbnb is an online marketplace that allows millions of people to rent their homes/apartment on short term basis to tourists. It provides a platform which connects over 4 million hosts and tourists. I want to explore how Airbnb empowers residential communities and understand the platform, customers, host's behaviour, popular neighbourhoods.

I want to create web application for Airbnb dataset in USA that provides an interactive dashboard containing visualisations to gain insights about Airbnb. I also plan to create an API that allows everyone including student, analysts or developers to easily fetch the data for their tasks.

## Objectives

- Relationship between properties in the listing with price.
- Analyze the neighbourhoods with their prices.
- Identify various types of properties available in the city.
- Visualize listing on a map based on attributes like price, reviews, property types.
- Find most used words used in top listings and reviews
